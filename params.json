{"name":"spectra-cluster-hadoop","tagline":"Clustering spectra using Hadoop ","body":"# Introduction\r\nspectra-cluster-hadoop is a MS spectrum clustering pipeline on [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) platform.\r\nThe pipeline consists of four [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html) jobs:\r\n\r\n1. Initial clustering job using highest peak clustering, assuming clustered spectra will share at least one of their most intense 6 peaks.\r\n2. Merge clusters according to their precursor m/z windows.\r\n3. Merge clusters again with a larger precursor m/z window.\r\n4. Output clusters into clustering result files.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nYou will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build spectra-cluster-hadoop.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mvn clean package\r\n```\r\nAfter the build, you should find spectra-cluster-hadoop-X.X.X.zip in the target folder.\r\n\r\n### Running the library\r\n\r\nUnzip the release of the library under a dedicated folder and execute the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./runClusteringJob.sh [main directory on HDFS] [job prefix] [output folder on HDFS]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Getting help\r\nIf you have questions or need additional help, please contact the PRIDE help desk at the EBI.\r\nemail: pride-support at ebi.ac.uk (replace at with @).\r\n\r\n# Giving your feedback\r\nPlease give us your feedback, including error reports, suggestions on improvements, new feature requests. You can do so by opening a new issue at our [issues section](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster-hadoop/issues)\r\n\r\n# How to cite\r\nPlease cite this library using one of the following publications:\r\n- Griss J, Foster JM, Hermjakob H, Vizca√≠no JA.
