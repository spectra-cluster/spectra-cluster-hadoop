# spectra-cluster-hadoop

# Introduction
spectra-cluster-hadoop is a MS spectrum clustering pipeline on [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) platform.
The pipeline consists of four [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html) jobs:

1. Initial clustering job using highest peak clustering, assuming clustered spectra will share at least one of their most intense 6 peaks.
2. Merge clusters according to their precursor m/z windows.
3. Merge clusters again with a larger precursor m/z window.
4. Output clusters into clustering result files.

# Getting started

### Installation
You will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build spectra-cluster-hadoop.

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```
After the build, you should find spectra-cluster-hadoop-X.X.X.zip in the target folder.

### Running the library

Unzip the release of the library under a dedicated folder and execute the following command.

```bash
$ ./runClusteringJob.sh [main directory on HDFS] [job prefix] [output folder on HDFS]
```
